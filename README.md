# odin-recipes
Making a simple HTML recipe website. The plan is to have a couple links to different recipes as well as brief descriptions of what the recipe is and its average time to prep.

The skills I aim to demonstrate will be using relative links vs absolute links. Using lists and different basic HTML tools like bold, italicize etc.

***After Project***
Through this project I have learned how to efficiently add and adjust image files in websites. I have also learned how to properly protect links using "noopener noreferrer".

I have also subsequently improved my git skills vastly!


# CSS Inclusion

For the second portion of my recipes project, I added an external CSS file "styles.css" to edit the appearance of the website. Through this process I worked with a couple different CSS properties like, "color", "font-family", "weight", "background-color". I used two selectors, an ID selector to edit all titles within my HTML files, and a Class selector to create consistent title-description formats.

Class selector: ."specifc" 
![Img of Title (Pink)](../images/pinkTitle.jpeg)

ID selector: ."titles"
![Img of Title-description (yellow)](../../images/yellowTitle.jpg)
