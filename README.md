Making a simple HTML recipe website. The plan is to have a couple links to different recipes as well as brief descriptions of what the recipe is and its average time to prep.

The skills I aim to demonstrate will be using relative links vs absolute links. Using lists and different basic HTML tools like bold, italicize etc.
